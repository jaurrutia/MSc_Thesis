 It is recommended to fill in this part of the document with the following information:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Your field: Context about the field your are working \\
	\textbf{Plasmonics -> Metameterials -> Biosensing}
	\item Motivation: Backgroung about your thesis work and why did you choose this project and why is it important.\\
	\textbf{Fabrication -> Partially embedded NPs -> No analytical (approximated) method physically introduces the incrustation degree. There are numerical solutions and Effective Medium Theories approaching the problem but the later only as a fitting method. }
	\item Objectives: What question are you answering with your work.\\
	\textbf{Can optical non invasive tests (IR-Vis) retrieve the average incrustation degree for monolayers of small spherical particles?}
	\item Methology: What are your secondary goals so you achieve your objective. Also, how are you answering yout question: which method or model.\\
	\textbf{Bruggeman homogenization theories on bidimensional systems?\\
	Is the dipolar approximation is enough or do we need more multipolar terms?\\
	Do we need the depolarization factors?}
	\item Structure: How is this thesis divides and what is the content of each chapter.
\end{itemize}
