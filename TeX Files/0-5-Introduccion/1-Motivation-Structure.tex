Optical metasurfaces are bidimensional arrays of metallic/dielectric nanostructures ---known as meta-atoms--- specifically tailored to behave in a way no found in nature when illuminated at a specific wavelength in the visible light regime \cite{khan_optical_2022,gonzalez-alcalde_large_2020}. Depending on the physical properties of the meta-atoms, that is, their material, size, shape, and orientation and distribution within the bidimensional array \cite{kim_plasmonic_2019,khan_optical_2022}, a metasurface  allows to shape at will the  spatial optical response of the system \cite{chen_review_2016}, thus suiting them for a variety of applications in fields such as Spectroscopy \cite{khan_optical_2022}, Color Structuration \cite{gonzalez-alcalde_large_2020} Communications \cite{chen_review_2016} and Sensing \cite{estevez_trends_2014,jain_noble_2008,khan_optical_2022,chen_review_2016,kim_plasmonic_2019}. In the last decades, the interest of optical metasurfaces in medical disciplines has increase due to  the need for sensitive, fast, low-cost and easy-to-use technologies \cite{estevez_trends_2014,kim_plasmonic_2019}, like metasurfaces with plasmonic (metallic) meta-atoms used as contrasting agents for Bioimaging  \cite{kim_plasmonic_2019} and as free-label biosensors returning real-time measurements \cite{estevez_trends_2014,kabashin_plasmonic_2009,khan_optical_2022}.

Metasurfaces designed for biosensing typically consist of a nanostructurated substrate with compatible microfluidics illuminated with a white light source and a light recollection system, allowing for scattering or extinction measurements, followed by an spectrometer \cite{estevez_trends_2014,feuz_improving_2010}. One particular kind of  biosensing-amied metasurfaces consist in plasmonic meta-atoms, which are employed since light can be confined at nanometric scales, yielding an improvement in the sensitivity of various detection techniques \cite{khan_optical_2022}. The light confinement is the result of the meta-atom's Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) being excited at the meta-atom's interface with its surroundings, which occurs when the electromagnetic fields couple to the free electrons of the plasmonic structure \cite{chen_review_2016,kim_plasmonic_2019,estevez_trends_2014}.  Since the LSPR is material and geometry dependent, a variety of plasmonic metasurfaces have been designed \cite{feuz_improving_2010,kabashin_plasmonic_2009,qiu_dual_2020,svedendahl_refractometric_2014} ---each with its own benefits and disadvantages \cite{chen_review_2016,estevez_trends_2014}--- as those shown in  Fig. \ref{fig:Back}, all of which are plasmonic metasurfaces consisting of gold (Au) meta-atoms on a glass substrate but with different geometries and distributions within the metasurface.  For example, Feuz et. al. \cite{feuz_improving_2010} employed a short-range ordered metasurface of nanoholes to sense protein binding events in real-time [Fig. \ref{sfig:back:a}], while  Kabashin et. al. \cite{kabashin_plasmonic_2009} measured  changes of the refractive index of the media embedding an ordered metasurface of plasmonic nanorods [Fig. \ref{sfig:back:b}].  Metasurfaces with simpler geometries and distributions can be used  for biosensing as well, as shown by Svedendahl et. al. \cite{svedendahl_refractometric_2014}, who sensed protein binding events with a short-range ordered metasurface of nanospheres [Fig. \ref{sfig:back:d}], or by  Qiu et. al. \cite{qiu_dual_2020}, who employed a disordered metasurface of nanospheres to detect selected DNA sequences from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [Fig. \ref{sfig:back:c}].

The manufacture of plasmonic metasurfaces undergo over several stages, which can be roughly divided in a theoretical design and the fabrication methods. The first estimates the optical response of the metasurface given the physical properties of the meta-atoms and its distribution along the metasurface; these optical properties can be determined either by numerical methods, like the Finite Element Method (FEM) \cite{feuz_improving_2010} or the Finite Differences Time Domain \cite{qiu_differential_2015}, both used either periodic arrays or for meta-atoms with complex geometries, or by analytical models, like the Thin Island Theory \cite{svedendahl_refractometric_2014,bedeaux_optical_2004}, the Dipolar Model \cite{barrera1991optical} ---both developed for disordered bidimensional arrays of nanospheres on a substrate--- and modifications to the  Maxwell Garnett Model \cite{sihvola_electromagnetic_2008}  ---originally developed for 3D colloidal systems of spheres--- to describe bidimensional systems of non-spherical meta-atoms as done by Kabashin et. al. \cite{kabashin_plasmonic_2009}.


 from the choice of the meta-atom's physical properties, their distribution through the metasurface and the fabrication methods to be employed, some of which are lithography technics ---electron beam lithography or hole-mask colloidal lithography, for example--- \cite{estevez_trends_2014}, thermal annealing of thin metallic films \cite{qiu_dual_2020}
is supported by the theoretical behavior of each meta-atom in the bidimensinoal array which may be calculated numerically and, when possible, analytically, 

Biosensing-aimed metasurfaces are supported onto a substrate and immersed in an aqueous medium, thus its performance is limited by its washability. One alternative to decrease a metasurface's washability is to partially embed it within the substrate while allowing the metasurface to still interact with the aqueous medium. In this work, we study the optical response of a single partially embedded metallic nanosphere  and extend its behavior analytically into a disordered metasurface by employing an effective medium approach.

The incrustation of the metasurface is studied by calculating the spectral behavior of a single partially embedded nanosphere with the Finite Element Method (FEM) and proposing an effective polarizability  in the elements of the metasurface.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Fabrication -> Partially embedded NPs -> No analytical (approximated) method physically introduces the incrustation degree. There are numerical solutions and Effective Medium Theories approaching the problem but the later only as a fitting method. }
	\item Objectives: What question are you answering with your work.\\
	\textbf{Can optical non invasive tests (IR-Vis) retrieve the average incrustation degree for monolayers of small spherical particles?}
	\item Methology: What are your secondary goals so you achieve your objective. Also, how are you answering yout question: which method or model.\\
	\textbf{Bruggeman homogenization theories on bidimensional systems?\\
	Is the dipolar approximation is enough or do we need more multipolar terms?\\
	Do we need the depolarization factors?}
	\item Structure: How is this thesis divides and what is the content of each chapter.
