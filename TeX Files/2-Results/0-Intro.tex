To compare the optical response of a NP in the presence of a substrate with that of a NP in a totally homogeneous environment, let us first analyze the spectral response given by the Mie Theory when the matrix and the size of the NP varies. In Fig. \ref{fig:Mie:redshift} it is shown the wavelength
 of resonance $\lambda_\text{res}$, that is the wavelength at which the scattering (orange) and extinction (black) efficiencies are maximized,  as function of the radius $a$ of a AuNP embedded in a matrix of air [Fig. \ref{sfig:red:1}] and of glass [Fig. \ref{sfig:red:2}], with a refractive index of $n_\text{m} = 1$ and $n_\text{m} = 1.5$, respectively, and as function of the refractive index of the matrix $n_\text{m}$ for a AuNP with a radius of {$a = 12.5$ nm} [Fig. \ref{sfig:red:3}] and with a radius of $a = 50$ nm [Fig. \ref{sfig:red:4}]. For the optical response of the AuNP it was employed the experimental data as reported (filled circles) by \citeauthor{johnson_optical_1972} \cite{johnson_optical_1972}  and by considering a size correction to it (empty circles).

From the results shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Mie:redshift} it can be seen that, in general, the wavelength of resonance  $\lambda_\text{res}$ for the extinction is smaller than for the scattering  and that the distance between them decreases as either the size of the AuNP or the refractive index of the matrix increase, meaning that the contribution of the scattering to the extinction of light becomes larger with these parameters as discussed in Section \ref{ss:AuMie}. The increase in these parameters also diminishes the difference between the results with and without a size correction but if these  are contrasted it can be noted that the resonance wavelength only redshifts as $a$ or $n_\text{m}$ grow when no size correction is considered (filled cirlces) but that a size corrected dielectric function give rise to a blueshift of $\lambda_\text{res}$ for values of radius $\lessapprox 15/n_\text{m}$ as seen if Figs. \ref{sfig:red:1} and \ref{sfig:red:2}.
