 It is recommended to fill in this part of the document with the following information:

Metasurfaces are bidimensaional arrays of unit cells with geometrical dimensions smaller than the wavelength of the incident light. Biosensing-aimed metasurfaces are supported onto a substrate and immersed in an aqueous medium, thus its performance is limited by its washability. One alternative to decrease a metasurface's washability is to partially embed it within the substrate while allowing the metasurface to still interact with the aqueous medium. In this work, we study the optical response of a single partially embedded metallic nanosphere  and extend its behavior analytically into a disordered metasurface by employing an effective medium approach.

The incrustation of the metasurface is studied by calculating the spectral behavior of a single partially embedded nanosphere with the Finite Element Method (FEM) and proposing an effective polarizability  in the elements of the metasurface.

	\textbf{Plasmonics -> Metameterials -> Biosensing}
	\item Motivation: Backgroung about your thesis work and why did you choose this project and why is it important.\\
	\textbf{Fabrication -> Partially embedded NPs -> No analytical (approximated) method physically introduces the incrustation degree. There are numerical solutions and Effective Medium Theories approaching the problem but the later only as a fitting method. }
	\item Objectives: What question are you answering with your work.\\
	\textbf{Can optical non invasive tests (IR-Vis) retrieve the average incrustation degree for monolayers of small spherical particles?}
	\item Methology: What are your secondary goals so you achieve your objective. Also, how are you answering yout question: which method or model.\\
	\textbf{Bruggeman homogenization theories on bidimensional systems?\\
	Is the dipolar approximation is enough or do we need more multipolar terms?\\
	Do we need the depolarization factors?}
	\item Structure: How is this thesis divides and what is the content of each chapter.
