Plasmonic metasurfaces, metallic nanostructures supported on a substrate, have been used as alternatives for biosensing due to their low-cost and easy-to-use features, and due to their light enhancement and confinement capacity. In common biosensing techniques, a liquid flows over the substrate, where the nanostructure is located, so there is a  detachment risk. Therefore, a partial embedding of the nanostructure in the substrate is desirable, which modifies its optical response under ideal conditions. In this thesis, it is studied the optical response of a single spherical gold nanoparticle of radius 12.5 nm, suited for biosensing-aimed-metasurfaces, when the nanosphere is partially embedded in between an air matrix and glass substrate, both which form a flat interface, and illuminated by an electromagnetic plane wave with wavelengths in the optical range, considering two states of polarization as well as different angles of incidence. The optical properties of the partially embedded nanosphere, that is, the scattering, absorption and extinction cross sections and the induced electric field in the near and far-field regimes, are calculated by means of the Finite Element Method and compared with the analytical solutions of two limiting cases: a nanosphere embedded in an infinite matrix of air, and in an infinite matrix of glass. Based on the obtained numerical results, it was determined optimal configurations for  biosensing with a disordered metasurface of partially embedded nanosphere of radius 12.5 nm in the diluted regime.

![normal](normal.png?raw=true "a] Absorption and b] scattering efficiencies of a 12.5 nm AuNP partially embedded in a glass substrate (ns = 1.5) with an air matrix (nm = 1) as a function of the wavelength λ of the incident electromagnetic plane wave with a wave vector ki perpendicular to the glass-air interface. The partial embedding of the AuNP is determined by the ratio h/a with a the AuNP’s radius and h the distance between the interface and the center of the AuNP. The green shaded region shows the two Mie-limiting cases of a AuNP embedded either in air or in glass; the magenta (partially embedded AuNP) and cyan (Mie-limiting) markers correspond to the efficiencies evaluated at the wavelength of resonance for each case; the gray dashed line is a guide to the eye.")
